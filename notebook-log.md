This is for notes!
## Dataset
* Na+/K+-ATPase gene family sequence from three clade of Eurytemora affinis species complex
* Na+/K+-ATPase gene family sequence from other Arthropod (Chelicerata/Myriapoda/crustacea/hexapoda)  
* Ref sequences filter based on:  
  MINIMUM PROTEIN SIZE=200  
  MINIMUM COVERAGE=50  
  MINIMUM SCAFOLD N50=10000  
  MAX SCAFOLD COUNT=9000
* Lee lab has found signatures of parallel selection acting on the paralogs of NKA gene family during independent invasion from saltwater to freshwater.  
  The goal is to construct the evolutionary history and molecular evolution of this crucial ion transporter in Arthropoda.
